# Week 13

## 11/12 - Monothematic Expositions

**Reminder**: [HW 10](HW-10.pdf) is due on Thursday

## 11/13 - Drill

Today we'll review Sonata Form terminology and look at a terrific quartet
by Haydn: the "Sunrise" Quartet, Op. 76/1.

## 11/14 - Developments

In lecture today we'll look at a few organizational strategies for the
development. Our main example will be the great Mozart D minor quartet,
K.421.

## 11/15 - Drill

**Reminder**: [HW 10](HW-10.pdf) is due before drill!

Today we'll study the Mozart F major Piano Sonata, K.332. This was the piece
that John used to demonstrate *topics*, but we'll revisit it today to look at
a few interesting harmonic passages and survey the overall form.

## 11/16 - Recapitulations

And finally, today we'll discuss the recapitulation. Usually recapitulations
are perfectly straightforward, but they can also be the site of some interesting
and unexpected plot twists. We'll revisit the Mozart G minor symphony and D minor
quartet, and take as our main example a Piano Sonata by Mozart.

(And keep an eye out for a Thanksgiving Bonus Quiz.)

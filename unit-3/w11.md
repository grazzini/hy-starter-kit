# Week 11

## 10/29 - The Classical Era

Today we'll introduce the late-eighteenth-century style of Mozart
and Haydn. There are lots of ways to approach this style. Today
we're going to focus on how Mozart and Haydn "dramatize" the
harmonic language they inherited from Corelli, Vivaldi, and Bach.

**Reminder**: Start bringing Part 2 of the Course Packet!

* Bach and Mozart
* Dramatizing Tonality: A Mozart opera scene
  * "Susana, or via sortite" from *The Marriage of Figaro*

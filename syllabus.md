eras as centers of exploration: the Renaissance, the Baroque, and the Classical eras. 
Components will include:

* Identifying musical styles, genres, forms and techniques.
* Analyzing and understanding musical structure and expression.
* Composing in earlier styles.
* Reading a variety of scores.
* Developing the ability to analyze music aurally.
* Writing about music.

### Grading Summary:

<table>
  <tr><td>3 Exams @ 150, 200, and 250 points respectively</td><td align=right>600</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3 Projects @ 60, 60, and 80 points respectively</td><td align=right>200</td></tr>

The letter grade will be assigned according to the following point totals:

<table>
  <tr><td>A+  =     975+</td><td>A  =  925-974</td><td>A-  =  900-924</td></tr>
  <tr><td>B+  =  875-899</td><td>B  =  825-874</td><td>B-  =  800-824</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C+  =  775-799</td><td>C  =  725-774</td><td>C-  =  700-724</td></tr>
  <tr><td>D+  =  675-699</td><td>D  =  625-674</td><td>D-  =  600-624</td></tr>
  <tr><td align=center colspan=3>F  =  599 and below</td></tr>

Attendance in drill section will be a factor in borderline cases. It can
raise **or lower** your grade!

### Further Information:

**Exams.** The exams will include listening portions as well as written portions. 
Exams 1 and 2 will each take place over two lecture sessions.

**Comprehensive make-up exam.** Unlike in T152, the comprehensive make-up exam may be 
taken ONLY if you miss one of the first two exams. It may NOT be taken to replace a 
previous score, or in place of the final exam. The exam will be given on Saturday, 
December 8 (the Saturday after classes end), beginning at 10 am. The listening portion 
will be given first; the written portion will follow at 10:30.

**Homework assignments.** Homework assignments may be due in lecture or in drill. They 
will normally be collected by your AI before lecture/drill begins. The following deductions 
will apply to assignments that are not turned in before class starts:

* -10% if turned in on due date but after the beginning of class
*	-20% if turned in one school day after due date
* no credit if turned in later than one school day after due date (your AI will still evaluate your assignment, but no grade will be recorded)

Late assignments should be turned in directly to your AI or directly to me. If you cannot 
find us in person, leave your assignment on my shelf in the Music Theory Office (M225H). 
Assignments left in AI files or outside my office door will not be accepted.

**Collaboration and plagiarism.** It can be beneficial to discuss general coursework issues 
with colleagues. But you may NOT copy another student’s assignment or work cooperatively 
to complete an assignment. As a general guideline, feel free to collaborate before you 
start writing; but once your pencil touches paper, all work must be your own. University 
regulations concerning academic honesty will be strictly enforced.

**Attendance.** Your AI will take attendance in every drill; your attendance will figure 
into your grade if you have a borderline grade at the end of the semester. Although no 
attendance will be taken at the lecture, poor attendance nearly always leads to a poor 
grade. New material will be presented at both lectures and drills.

* There will be no make-up and no advance tests for any reasons except official School of 
Music tours and similar events, or on account of religious observances. These arrangements 
should be made early in the semester and before the event.

* Students who miss an exam (or part of an exam) for any other reason must take the 
comprehensive make-up exam at the end of the semester.

**Incompletes and Withdrawals.** A grade of Incomplete (I) is reserved for extraordinary 
circumstances (such as a serious illness or death in the family at or near the end of the 
semester). Please contact me as soon as possible if a problem arises. An automatic grade 
of (W) is possible without my approval until Sunday, October 21.

**Resources for help with writing.** The Writing Tutorial Services at the Information 
Commons in the Wells Library offers both appointments and walk-in services for planning, 
developing, and revising your writing. See: http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/wts/home.html or 
call 855-6738.

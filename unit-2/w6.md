# Week 6

## 9/24 - Introduction: The Age of Thoroughbass

Today we'll dive into the Baroque period. Our focus will be on the method of
accompanying from a thoroughbass. This seemingly minor technical innovation was
actually so important to baroque composers and performers that the baroque
period has been called "The Age of Thoroughbass." We'll introduce two pieces by
Monteverdi that use thoroughbass accompaniments, and we'll also take a moment
to revisit two of the madrigals from the last unit.

* Introduction to the Baroque
  * Revisiting _Il lamento d'Arianna_ and "Cruda Amarilli"
  * Thoroughbass and continuo accompaniment
  * Monteverdi, _Orfeo_, "Tu sei morta"
* Review of figured bass symbols
* Guidelines for interpreting unfigured basses
* The "Lament Bass"
  * Monteverdi, "Il lamento della ninfa" (from the Eighth Book of Madrigals)

Terms: Thoroughbass, _Basso continuo_ Figured bass, Unfigured bass, realization, reduction, Lament bass, opera, _Stile recitativo_.

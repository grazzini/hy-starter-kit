# Week 6

## 9/24 - The Baroque Era

Today we'll dive into the Baroque period. Our focus will be on the method of
accompanying from a thoroughbass. This seemingly minor technical innovation was
actually so important to baroque composers and performers that the baroque
period has been called "The Age of Thoroughbass." We'll introduce two pieces by
Monteverdi that use thoroughbass accompaniments, and we'll also take a moment
to revisit two of the madrigals from the last unit.

* Introduction to the Baroque
  * Revisiting [_Il lamento d'Arianna_](../unit-1/lamento-di-arianna-solo.pdf) and ["Cruda Amarilli"](../unit-1/cruda-amarilli.pdf)
  * Thoroughbass and continuo accompaniment
  * Monteverdi, _Orfeo_, "Tu sei morta" ([score](tu-sei-morta.pdf), [translation](/translations/tu-sei-morta.html))
* Review of [Figured Bass Notation](figured-bass-notation.pdf)
* [Guidelines](17th-c-guidelines.pdf) for interpreting unfigured basses

## 9/26 - Basso ostinato variations

Today we'll be looking at several _basso ostinato_, or "Ground Bass" patterns,
and at a few pieces that use them. We'll also introduce the "rule of the octave",
which was the most important pattern for harmonizing unfigured basses in the
eighteenth century.

## 9/28 - The improvised prelude

genre, and look at examples by Le Roux, Purcell, Bach, and François Couperin.

(We'll also have a special guest performer!)

## 10/10 - The Baroque Fugue

Today we'll introduce the Fugue, which sometimes seems like the quintessential
baroque genreâ€”largely because of the importance we place on Bach, and particularly
on Bach's *Well-Tempered Clavier*, a collection of preludes and fugues in all the
major and minor keys.

In today's drill, we'll practice writing "real" and "tonal" answers to fugue subjects.
This is in preparation for Project 2, which is a fugue-composition project.

## 10/12 - More on the Fugue

Reminder [Homework 6](HW-6.pdf) is due before lecture!

And on Friday we'll be continuing with Bach fugues. Today we'll study a couple
of great fugues that are a little bit different from the fugues of the WTC. We'll
also discuss the last two assigments for Unit 2.

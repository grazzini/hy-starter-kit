# Week 10

## 10/22: Summing Up

Reminder: **[Project 2](Project-2.pdf) is due before lecture!**

## 10/23: Drill: Listening Exam Review

Review for the listening exam. Highly recommended!

## 10/24: Listening Exam 2

The listening exam will be in Sweeney Hall. You'll hear seven or eight excerpts
from the [repertoire list](/unit-2/#listening-list) and be asked to identify the
piece, the composer, and the genre for each excerpt. You'll also be asked a few
background questions about the genres, and a few **analytical** questions about
the excerpts. (These will focusing on the musical techniques used, and particularly
on imitation, cadences, and sequences.)

To receive full credit on the identification questions, be sure to use the full
name of the piece, as it appears on the listening list! (For example, "Mass in
B minor, Agnus Dei" would be a good identification. "Agnus Dei" would not be so
good.)

## 10/25: Drill: Written Exam Review

Today's drill will review for the written exam.

## 10/26: Written Exam 2

The written exam will also be in Sweeney Hall. You'll do a few writing
excercises that resemble things you've done on homework assignments, as
well as a few short answer questions and score analyses. For the score
analysis, you may be asked to **identify the piece** (as in the listening
exam) and to analyze imitation, cadences, sequences, etc.

# Week 4

## 9/10: Byrd

**Reminder**: [HW4](HW-4.pdf) is due on Friday!

We'll start today by introducing first species counterpoint in three
parts. We'll look briefly at how Renaissance musicians would have 
described the things that we call root-position and first-inversion 
triads. Then we'll look at one or two mass movements by William Byrd,
and briefly discuss his position as a Catholic composer in Tudor
England.

## 9/12: Text Setting

**Reminder**: [HW4](HW-4.pdf) is due on Friday!

Today we'll look at two motets by Palestrina, focusing on how he 
sets poetic texts. We'll also revisit briefly the Modes and the 
Hexachord, partly for exam review, and partly because there is a 
lot of really entertaining historical material related to these
subjects.

* Palestrina, "Surge, amica mea" (motet)
  * [Translation](/translations/surge-amica-mea.html), [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWN55FrYDfs&index=13&list=PLYyTDR5WeGuTtL7G92HVmXBzi6G2xiL1a)

## 9/14: The _Seconda Pratica_

Today we'll discuss what happened when progressive composers at the 
end of the Renaissance started breaking the rules of counterpoint for
expressive effects. We'll look at a famous example of this kind of 
rule-breaking, in Monteverdi's madrigal "Cruda Amarilli". Then we'll
discuss the critical reaction to that piece and some of the ways that 
Monteverdi and his supporters defended it.

* [HW4](HW-4.pdf) is due before class
* Background on Monteverdi
* Monteverdi, "Cruda Amarilli"
  * [Translation](/translations/cruda-amarilli.html), [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nJ4dEjjIY4&index=25&list=PLYyTDR5WeGuTtL7G92HVmXBzi6G2xiL1a)

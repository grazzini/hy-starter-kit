# Week 4

## 9/10: Byrd, Byrd, Byrd

**Reminder**: [HW4](HW-4.pdf) is due on Friday!

We'll start today by introducing first species counterpoint in three
parts. We'll look briefly at how Renaissance musicians would have
described the things that we call root-position and first-inversion
triads. Then we'll study some sacred music by William Byrd, discussing
his position as a Catholic composer in Tudor England. The motet
"Civitas sancti tui," in particular, may be a useful point of reference
for you as you work on [Project 1](Project-1.pdf). (Due next Monday.)

## 9/14: The _Seconda Pratica_

Today we'll discuss what happened when progressive composers at the
end of the Renaissance started breaking the rules of counterpoint for
expressive effects. We'll look at a famous example of this kind of
rule-breaking in Monteverdi's madrigal "Cruda Amarilli". Then we'll
discuss the critical reaction to that piece and some of the ways that
Monteverdi and his supporters defended it. ([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_5f8rvJgDRlNlynAD-UbYuwA2nmfudCeYNP9PB3YiUs/edit?usp=sharing))

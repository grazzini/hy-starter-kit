# Week 4

## 9/10: Byrd, Byrd, Byrd

**Reminder**: [HW4](HW-4.pdf) is due on Friday!

We'll start today by introducing first species counterpoint in three
parts. We'll look briefly at how Renaissance musicians would have 
described the things that we call root-position and first-inversion 
triads. Then we'll study some sacred music by William Byrd, discussing
his position as a Catholic composer in Tudor England. The motet 
"Civitas sancti tui," in particular, may be a useful point of reference
for you as you work on [Project 1](Project-1.pdf). (Due next Monday.)

## 9/12: Text Setting

**Reminder**: [HW4](HW-4.pdf) is due on Friday!

## 9/14: The _Seconda Pratica_

Today we'll discuss what happened when progressive composers at the 
end of the Renaissance started breaking the rules of counterpoint for
expressive effects. We'll look at a famous example of this kind of 
rule-breaking in Monteverdi's madrigal "Cruda Amarilli". Then we'll
discuss the critical reaction to that piece and some of the ways that 
Monteverdi and his supporters defended it.

* [HW4](HW-4.pdf) is due before class
* Background on Monteverdi
* Monteverdi, "Cruda Amarilli"
  * [Translation](/translations/cruda-amarilli.html), [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nJ4dEjjIY4&index=25&list=PLYyTDR5WeGuTtL7G92HVmXBzi6G2xiL1a)

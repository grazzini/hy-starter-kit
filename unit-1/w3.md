## 9/5: The Hexachord

**Reminder**: [HW3](HW-3.pdf) is due on Friday

Today we'll discuss the "Hexachord", which is the six-note system that
Medieval and Renaissance musicians used for sight-singing. It has a lot
in common with modern "moveable-do" sight-singing, but there are some
important differences, too.

Then we'll look at a mass by Palestrina that uses the hexachord as its
subject. ([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lMVXaF71VdiXn5tG-IuKqdLFsFJqYlWeP6mabTI32cA/edit?usp=sharing))

## 9/7: Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae

Today we'll wrap up with the Hexachord, and then look at another mass
whose subject is derived from hexachordal solmization syllables. We'll
also introduce Project 1, which is an analysis of a motet by William Byrd.

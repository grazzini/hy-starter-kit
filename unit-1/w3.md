# Week 3

## 9/3: Labor Day

(No lecture today.)

## 9/4: Drill

* Return Homework 2 ([HW3](HW-3.pdf) is due on Friday!)
* Practice writing in Fourth Species

## 9/5: The Hexachord

Today we'll discuss the "Hexachord", which is the six-note system that 
Medieval and Renaissance musicians used for sight-singing. It has a lot 
in common with modern "moveable-do" sight-singing, but there are some 
important differences, too.

Then we'll look at a mass by Palestrina that uses the hexachord as its
subject.

## 9/7: Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae

Today we'll look at another mass whose subject is derived from hexachordal
solmization syllables. Then we'll look at Project 1, which is an analysis
of an Anthem by William Byrd. To help prepare for the project, today we'll 
study a different anthem by Byrd and look at some of the issues that you'll 
need to discuss in the Project.

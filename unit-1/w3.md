# Week 3

## 9/3: Labor Day

(No lecture today.)

## 9/4: Drill

* Return Homework 2 ([HW3](HW-3.pdf) is due on Friday!)
* Practice writing in Fourth Species

## 9/5: The Hexachord

Today we'll discuss the "Hexachord", which is the six-note system that 
Medieval and Renaissance musicians used for sight-singing. It has a lot 
in common with modern "moveable-do" sight-singing, but there are some 
important differences, too.

Then we'll look at a mass by Palestrina that uses the hexachord as its
subject.

## 9/7: Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae

Today we'll wrap up with the Hexachord, and then look at another mass whose
subject is derived from hexachordal solmization syllables. Then we'll introduce
Project 1, which is an analysis of a motet by William Byrd. To help prepare
for the project, today we'll look at a different motet by Byrd and study some
of the issues that you'll need to discuss in the Project.

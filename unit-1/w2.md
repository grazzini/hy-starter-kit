# Week 2

## 8/27: More about cadences

Today we'll be studying a wonderful little Chanson by Josquin.
We'll also introduce the Second Species of counterpoint, which 
adds passing tones and a little bit of rhythmic complexity. And 
we'll discuss three-part cadences and the evaded cadence.

## 8/29: Pre-existing material

Then we'll describe the three principal ways that pre-existing material

beautiful example of the **paraphrase** technique: Josquin's famous 6-part 
motet "Benedicta es, caelorum regina." ([Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fy7gucSArQHdbaAWSPBS9Dpch894R1SrTYrPVatUhcA/edit?usp=sharing))

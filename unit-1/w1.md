# Week 1

## 8/20 - Introduction

**Welcome!** In our first meeting, we'll look briefly at the syllabus 
and discuss the organization of the course and its place in the undergraduate
theory curriculum. Then–since for most of us Renaissance music is less 
familiar than the music of Bach or Mozart–we'll spend some time
introducing the Renaissance style.

* Overview of the course
* Comparison of [Classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Twh_q8lQs) and [Renaissance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlB1HR4BgUg&list=PLYyTDR5WeGuTtL7G92HVmXBzi6G2xiL1a&index=8&t=51s) styles
* Introduction to Renaissance Counterpoint

**Terms.** Cantus firmus, counterpoint, consonance/dissonance, parallel/similar/oblique/contrary motion, 
Species Counterpoint, First Species.

**Handout**: [Guidelines 1 - First Species](guidelines-1.pdf)

## 8/21 - Drill

In the first drill section, you'll get to know the Renaissance style
"from the inside", by singing a fun little three-part Chanson. After
that you'll start work on Species Counterpoint, working on an exercise
in First Species.

* Singing: Vive la marguerite (CP:1, [score](vive-la-marguerite.pdf))
* Practice First Species counterpoint

## 8/22 - Cadences, _Missa pange lingua_

Today we'll look in more detail at the Josquin Missa pange lingua. We'll 
discuss how the Kyrie is organized and how Josquin derives the subjects
from a plainchant hymn. Then, we'll look at how cadences work in Renaissance
music, and how they differ from the harmonic cadences you're familiar with
from last year.

* Analysis of Josquin, _Missa pange lingua_ (CP:14)
  * Pange Lingua: Plainchant Hymn [melody](pange-lingua.pdf) and [score/recording](http://gregorian-chant-hymns.com/hymns-2/pange-lingua.html)
  * [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlB1HR4BgUg&t=0s&index=8&list=PLYyTDR5WeGuTtL7G92HVmXBzi6G2xiL1a)
* The Renaissance Cadence
* Reminder: **[Homework 1](HW-1.pdf)** is due next Monday

**Terms.** Mass, Ordinary, Kyrie, plainchant, imitation, subject, free counterpoint, 
point of imitation, paired imitation.  Cadence, suspension, tenor/cantus formulas. 

**Handout**: [Renaissance Cadences](cadences.pdf)

## 8/23 - Drill

* Singing: Vive la marguerite
* Practice First Species counterpoint 

## 8/24 - Modes, _Missa beata vergine_

Today we'll discuss the Modes, which are not exactly what you might expect. We'll 
look at how Renaissance musicians described the modes, and how they can be used 
to classify melodies and polyphonic compositions. Then we'll look at the Kyrie 
from another great Josquin mass.

(And as a reminder, don't forget that HW1 is due on Monday!)

* Modes in the Renaissance
* Josquin, _Missa beata vergine_, Kyrie (CP:5)

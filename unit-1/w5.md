## 9/11: Drill: Listening Exam Review

A helpful review for the listening exam. Highly recommended!

## 9/12: Listening Exam 1

The listening exam will be in Sweeney Hall. You'll hear seven or eight excerpts
from the [repertoire list](/unit-1/#listening-list) and be asked to identify the
piece, the composer, and the genre for each excerpt. You'll also be asked a few
background questions about the genres, and a few **analytical** questions about
the excerpts. (These will focusing on the musical techniques used, and particularly
on imitation, cadences, and word painting.)

To receive full credit on the identification questions, be sure to use the full
name of the piece, as it appears on the listening list! (For example, "Missa
Hercules dux Ferrariae" would be a good identification. "Hercules" would be not
so good.)

## 9/13: Drill: Written Exam Review

Today's drill will review for the written exam.

## 9/14: Written Exam 1

The written exam will also be in Sweeney Hall. You'll do a few writing
excercises that resemble things you've done on homework assignments, as
well as a few short answer questions and score analyses. For the score
analysis, you may be asked to **identify the piece** (as in the listening
exam) and to analyze imitation, cadences, word-painting, etc.

# Week 5

## 9/17: Monteverdi

Reminder: **[Project 1](Project-1.pdf) is due before drill!**

Today we'll look at two more madrigals by Monteverdi, and then spend some
time wrapping up Unit 1.

## 9/11: Drill: Listening Exam Review

Today's drill will be a helpful review for the listening exam. Highly
recommended! Five stars!

## 9/12: Listening Exam 1

The listening exam will be in Sweeney Hall. You'll hear seven or eight excerpts
from the [repertoire list](/unit-1/#listening-list) and be asked to identify the
piece, the composer, and the genre for each excerpt. You'll also be asked a few
background questions about the genres, and a few *analytical* questions about the
excerpts. (Focusing on the musical techniques used, particularly the imitation
and cadences.)

To receive full credit on the identification questions, be sure to use the full
name of the piece, as it appears on the listening list!

## 9/13: Drill: Written Exam Review

Today's drill will review for the written exam.

## 9/14: Written Exam 1

The written exam will also be in Sweeney Hall. You'll do a mix of writing
excercises along the lines of the homeworks, as well as a few short answer
questions and score analyses. For the score analysis, you may be asked to
identify the piece (as in the listening exam) as well as to analyze imitation,
cadences, etc.
